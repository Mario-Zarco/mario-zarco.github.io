I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees from the National Autonomous University of Mexico and completed my PhD at the University of Auckland. I am now working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Hokkaido University Center for Human Nature, Artificial Intelligence, and Neuroscience.

I am driven by philosophically minded interdisciplinary collaboration. My experience includes building computational models and analysing data of cognitive behavior.
